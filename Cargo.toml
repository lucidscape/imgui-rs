description = """
IMGUI-RS provides Rust bindings for IMGUI, a bloat-free intermediate mode GUI library for C/C++.

IMGUI outputs vertex buffers that you can render in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained.

IMGUI does away with state synchronization by requiring the application to explicitly pass all state required in real-time. The user interface only retains the minimal amount of state required to facilitate the functionality required by each type of widget supported by the system.
